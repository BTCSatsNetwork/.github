## About Us

We are a team of innovators dedicated to enhancing the Bitcoin ecosystem by developing a Layer 2 solution called Sats Blockchain. Our technology leverages Sats (BRC-20) token as gas to provide a scalable, efficient, and low-cost environment for a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps). Sats Chain is built on the BEVM Stack, ensuring compatibility and performance.
